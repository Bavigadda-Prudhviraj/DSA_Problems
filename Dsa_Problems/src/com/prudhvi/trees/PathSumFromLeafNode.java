	Problem Description
			Given a binary tree and a sum, determine if the tree has a root-to-leaf path such that adding up all the values along the path equals the given sum.
	Problem Constraints
			1 <= number of nodes <= 105
			-100000 <= B, value of nodes <= 100000

	The goal of the method is to determine whether there exists a path from the root to a leaf node in the binary tree such that the sum of node values along the path is equal to the given sum. 
	The method returns a boolean value indicating whether such a path exists.
	
	Time Complexity:
			Best Case Scenario (Balanced Binary Tree):
					1.In the best case scenario, the code will find the target path relatively early in the traversal. 
					  This could happen in the first few levels of the tree, so the algorithm will not need to traverse all nodes.
					2.The time complexity in this case is determined by the height of the tree. 
					  For a balanced binary tree, the height is approximately logâ‚‚(N), where N is the number of nodes.
					Therefore, the best-case time complexity is O(log N), where N is the number of nodes in the tree.
			Worst Case Scenario (Skewed Binary Tree):
					1.In the worst case scenario, the code might need to explore all nodes in the tree to find the path with the target sum.
					2.In this case, the code visits each node once, and the recursive calculations and updates take constant time.
					Therefore, the worst-case time complexity is O(N), where N is the number of nodes in the tree.
	Space Complexity:
			The space complexity is determined by the maximum depth of the recursive call stack during traversal. 
			This occurs in the worst-case scenario, which is when the tree is completely skewed (essentially a linked list).
			Best Case Scenario: The space complexity in the best case is the same as the height of the balanced tree, which is O(log N).
			Worst Case Scenario: The space complexity in the worst case is the maximum depth of the skewed tree, which is O(N).
