	Problem Description
		Given an array of integers, every element appears thrice except for one, which occurs once.
		Find that element that does not appear thrice.
	NOTE: 
		Your algorithm should have a linear runtime complexity.
		Could you implement it without using extra memory?
	Problem Constraints
		2 <= A <= 5*106
		0 <= A <= INTMAX

	The function UniqueElement takes an array arr as input, which contains integers. 
	All elements in the array appear three times, except for one unique element that appears only once. 
	The goal of the function is to find and return that unique element.
	
	Time Complexity: 
			The time complexity of this code is O(32 * n) â‰ˆ O(n), where n is the number of elements in the input array arr. 
			The outer loop iterates 31 times (for each bit position), and the inner loop iterates through all elements in arr, 
			which takes linear time.

	Space Complexity: 
			The space complexity of this code is O(1), as it uses a constant amount of extra memory, independent of the input size. 
			The additional space is used for the variables answer, str, setBitsCount, and LeftShiftnum, all of which require a constant amount of memory.
