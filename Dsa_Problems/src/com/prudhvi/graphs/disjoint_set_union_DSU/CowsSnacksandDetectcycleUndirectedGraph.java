	Problem Description
		The legendary Farmer John is throwing a huge party, and animals from all over the world are hanging out at his house. His guests are hungry, so he instructs his cow Bessie to bring out the snacks! Moo!
		There are A snacks flavors, numbered with integers 1,2,â€¦,A. Bessie has A snacks, one snack of each flavor. There are M guests and every guest has exactly two favorite flavors. The procedure for eating snacks will go as follows:
		First, Bessie will line up the guests in some way.
		Each guest in their turn will eat all remaining snacks of their favorite flavor. In case no favorite flavors are present when a guest goes up, they become very sad.
		Help Bessie to minimize the number of sad guests by lining the guests in an optimal way.
	Problem Constraints
		2 <= A <= 100000
		1 <= M <= 100000
		1 <= B[i][0] , B[i][1] <= A
		B[i][0] != B[i][1]
	Input Format
		First argument of input contains a single integer A.
		Second argument of input contains a M x 2 integer matrix B denoting favorite flavors of each guest.

	Time Complexity:
		The code iterates through the favFlavours array once, performing union operations and checks for whether two guests prefer the same flavor. These operations take nearly constant time due to the efficient union-find data structure. Therefore, the time complexity is O(favFlavours.length).
	Space Complexity:
		The primary space usage is for the DsuCS data structure, which has a size of flavours + 1. Therefore, the space complexity is O(flavours).
