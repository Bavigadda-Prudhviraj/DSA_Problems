	Problem Description
			Given a undirected graph having A nodes. A matrix B of size M x 2 is given which represents the edges such that there is an edge between B[i][0] and B[i][1].
			Find whether the given graph is bipartite or not.
			A graph is bipartite if we can split it's set of nodes into two independent subsets A and B such that every edge in the graph has one node in A and another node in B
			Note:
				There are no self-loops in the graph.
				No multiple edges between two pair of vertices.
				The graph may or may not be connected.
				Nodes are Numbered from 0 to A-1.	
				Your solution will run on multiple test cases. If you are using global variables make sure to clear them.

	Problem Constraints
		1 <= A <= 100000
		1 <= M <= min(A*(A-1)/2,200000)
		0 <= B[i][0],B[i][1] < A

	Time Complexity:
		The code iterates through all vertices exactly once, setting their color or checking their colors. This takes O(a) time.
		The BFS traversal from each vertex takes O(a + b) time in total because, in the worst case, you visit all vertices and edges once.
		So, the overall time complexity is O(a + b).
	Space Complexity:
		The space complexity is determined by the data structures used.
		The graph array, colour array, and the queue each consume O(a) space.
		Therefore, the overall space complexity is O(a).
	In summary, the code efficiently determines if the input graph is bipartite using BFS traversal. Its time complexity is O(a + b), and its space complexity is O(a), where a is the number of vertices, and b is the number of edges in the graph.
