	Problem Description
		The n-queens puzzle is the problem of placing n queens on an n√ón chess board such that no two queens attack each other.
		Given an integer A, return all distinct solutions to the n-queens puzzle.
		Each solution contains a distinct board configuration of the n-queens' placement, where 'Q' and '.' both indicate a queen and an empty space respectively.
		The final list should be generated in such a way that the indices of the queens in each list should be in reverse lexicographical order.
	Problem Constraints
		1 <= A <= 10

	Time Complexity:
			The backtracking approach tries out all possible positions for the queens, while considering constraints to ensure no two queens threaten each other.
			The time complexity depends on the number of valid solutions that can be found for the N-Queens problem.
		    The exact time complexity can vary depending on the size of the chess board and the number of valid solutions.
		 Therefore, the overAll time complexity is N^N.
	Space Complexity:
			The space complexity is determined by the recursion stack and additional data structures.
			The recursion stack can go as deep as the number of rows (N).
			The chessBoard 2D array requires O(N^2) space.
			The arrays colCheck, leftDig, and rightDig each require O(2N-1) space (constant space).
		Therefore, the overall space complexity is O(N^2) for the chess board and additional data structures.

	Check Function:
		Certainly! In the N-Queens problem, the colCheck, leftDig, and rightDig arrays are used to keep track of the columns and diagonals that are threatened by queens placed on the chessboard. These arrays help in quickly identifying if it's safe to place a queen in a particular cell during the backtracking process.
				colCheck array:
							1.The colCheck array is a boolean array of size col, where col represents the number of columns on the chess board. 
							   It tracks which columns are currently occupied by queens.
							2.When a queen is placed in a specific column, the corresponding element in the colCheck array is marked as true, indicating that this column is occupied.
				leftDig and rightDig arrays:
						The leftDig and rightDig arrays are boolean arrays used to track diagonals on the chess board.
							1.The size of these arrays is calculated as row + col - 1 (or 2N - 1), where row represents the current row, and col represents the number of columns.
							2.The reason for this size is that there are row + col - 1 diagonals in total in a square chess board.
						The index of a diagonal can be calculated as (row + col - 1), which ranges from 0 to 2N - 2.
				How the checks work:
						When attempting to place a queen in a particular cell (row, col), the code checks three conditions to determine if it's safe:
							1.No queen exists in the same column: 
									Check colCheck[col] to see if that column is already occupied by a queen.
							2.No queen exists on the same left diagonal: 
									Check leftDig[row + col] to see if that diagonal is already threatened.
							3.No queen exists on the same right diagonal: 
									Check rightDig[row - col + (col - 1)] to see if that diagonal is already threatened.
							If all three conditions are satisfied (i.e., no conflicts), the queen can be placed in the current cell. After placement, the corresponding elements in colCheck, leftDig, and rightDig arrays are updated to reflect the new threats.
							
				During backtracking, when the queen is removed from the current cell, the updates to the arrays are reversed to their previous states, allowing the exploration of other possibilities.
				
		Overall, these arrays allow the code to quickly determine whether a particular cell is safe to place a queen or not, which helps avoid unnecessary recursive exploration in the backtracking process. This efficient checking mechanism contributes to the algorithm's ability to find solutions for larger board sizes.

							In health care settings, assigning nurses to shifts while considering their preferences and avoiding conflicts in schedules can be formulated as an N-Queens problem.
					Crossword Puzzle Generation: 
							Designing crossword puzzles involves placing words on a grid such that they intersect correctly. The N-Queens problem has similarities with this challenge.
					Resource Allocation: 
							When allocating resources, such as allocating classrooms to courses in a school, you need to avoid conflicts and efficiently utilize available resources. The N-Queens problem can offer insights into solving such allocation challenges.
					Game AI and Path finding: 
							In game development, the N-Queens problem can be abstracted to solve path finding or movement problems for characters or objects on a grid-based map.
			While the N-Queens problem might not be directly applicable to these domains, it provides a valuable framework for thinking about and solving problems involving arrangement, constraint satisfaction, and optimization.
