/**
 * Solution to LeetCode #3442: Maximum Difference Between Even and Odd Frequency (Medium).
 * Given a string s, find the maximum difference between the frequency of any character with an odd
 * frequency and any character with an even frequency. If there are no characters with even or odd
 * frequency, the corresponding frequency is considered 0, and the result can be negative.
 * This solution uses a HashMap to count character frequencies and then finds the minimum even
 * frequency and maximum odd frequency to compute the difference.
 *
 * Time Complexity: O(n)
 * - Iterating through the string to build the frequency map takes O(n), where n is the string length.
 * - Iterating through the map entries (at most 26 for lowercase letters or bounded by unique characters)
 *   takes O(1) for practical purposes, as itâ€™s independent of n.
 * - Total: O(n).
 *
 * Space Complexity: O(k)
 * - The HashMap stores at most k entries, where k is the number of unique characters in the string
 *   (bounded by 26 for lowercase letters in typical constraints).
 * - Additional variables (minEvenFrequency, maxOddFrequency) use O(1) space.
 * - Total: O(k), effectively O(1) for a fixed alphabet.
