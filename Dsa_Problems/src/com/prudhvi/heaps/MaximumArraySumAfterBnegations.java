	Problem Description
			Given an array of integers A and an integer B. You must modify the array exactly B number of times. In a single modification, we can replace any one array element A[i] by -A[i].
			You need to perform these modifications in such a way that after exactly B modifications, sum of the array must be maximum.
	Problem Constraints
			1 <= length of the array <= 5*105
			1 <= B <= 5 * 106
			-100 <= A[i] <= 100

	Method find the maximum possible sum of the elements in the array after performing a specific number of negations (changing the sign of certain elements). 
	The approach used here is to utilize a min-heap to maintain the smallest elements and manage the negations effectively.
	
	Time Complexity:
			Adding all elements from the array to the min heap takes O(N * log N) time, where N is the number of elements in the array.
			The loop that processes negations runs at most N times.
			Calculating the total sum takes O(N) time, as it involves summing up all elements in the min heap.
		Therefore, the overall time complexity of the function is O(N * log N).
	Space Complexity:
			The space complexity is determined by the storage used for the priority queue (minHeap), which can hold a maximum of N elements.
			Additionally, a constant amount of extra space is used for variables and temporary storage.
		Therefore, the overall space complexity is O(N).
