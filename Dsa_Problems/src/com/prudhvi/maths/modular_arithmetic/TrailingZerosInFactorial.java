	Problem Description
		Given an integer A, return the number of trailing zeroes in A! i.e., factorial of A.

		Your solution should run in logarithmic time complexity.

	Problem Constraints
		1 <= A <= 109

	The trailingZeroes method calculates the number of trailing zeros in the factorial of a given integer A. 
	It uses a simple iterative approach to count the number of factors of 5 in the numbers from 1 to A. 
	The method returns the count of trailing zeros.
	
	Time Complexity:
		The time complexity of this code is O(log â‚… num) O(log base5 num), where A is the input integer. 
		The loop iterates until A becomes less than powerOf5, which happens when powerOf5 exceeds A. 
		The number of iterations required to reach this point is logarithmic in A with base 5.
	
	Space Complexity:
		The space complexity of this code is O(1) because it uses a constant amount of additional space to store the variables answer and powerOf5.
